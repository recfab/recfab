## RE: [ position ]

To whom it may concern,

My name is Yael Namen.
I am a software developer with 15+ years experience across several fields, doing full-stack web development---focusing on backend and system design---and more recently, DevOps and infrastructure engineering.
I am detail oriented, and enjoy working on hard problems.
I am passionate about improving things for the whole team/org. That can mean process improvements; writing docs; picking up the work other folks don't have the time/interest to pick up (e.g. this is how I got into DevOps).
I am always learning, and enjoy sharing what I know with other engineers, whether through mentoring, book clubs, or tech talks.

[ Specific example aligned with something big they're asking ]
